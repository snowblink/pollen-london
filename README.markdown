# Pollen London

A simple ruby script which posts pollen levels to Twitter.

The BBC website supplies pollen data, but no RSS.
Useful to know if you are a hayfever sufferer.

This script runs on heroku and updates [@pollen_london](http://twitter.com/pollen_london) with the pollen status daily (if there is any data).
