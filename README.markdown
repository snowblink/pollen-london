# Pollen London

A simple ruby script which posts pollen levels to Twitter.

The BBC website supplies pollen data, but no RSS. Useful to know if you are a hayfever sufferer. I have this script cronned on a server to update [@pollen_london](http://twitter.com/pollen_london) with the pollen status daily.
